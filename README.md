Hi there! Brand new to coding but would like to use coding as a technical tool to materialize my creative expressions within!
Not sure what languages I like since I only know VERY small amounts of HTML and CSS...and that's it right now.

I currently work in the restaurant industry and in selling a semi-shitty eBook online and hope to transition into a career from which I can build my entrepreneurial dreams off of! 

Journey to being an employed web developer starts with many, many steps...and this is step one.

To pushing forward on this long journey!

Cheers, yinz guys (Pittsburgh here)
